# IIF-Round-2-PitchLab

Hello ! I am Mohammad Masham

This is my second big project on Web Development and my first project having a deadline 
I did not anticipated that what I wanted to create would have taken so long and in no time deadline approached .
In the end , due to shortage of time :
  *I could not create a responsive website 
  *I could not make separate pages for registration and About us
  *Though I am just a beginner in Javascript , I could have made a Sticky header and a different sliding navigation for mobile users .
  *I could have done little Search Engine Optimization 
  *There are a lot many things that I wanted to do 
  *It was a great learning Experience for me.
  *Thankyou!*
